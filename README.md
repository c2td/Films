# Films

An Android application that displays a film listing using The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

The current version displays the most popular new releases for the last month. Clicking on the poster opens another page with more detailed info about the film and also provides a link for opening the video trailer if available.

Ideas for future improvements:

* Add an option to mark favourite films
* Add an option to add films to a "To watch" list
* Make dynamic queries based on user input
